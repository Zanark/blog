The video will be a puppet voice over experiment with green screen in the background for the actual screen to overlay it.

I start with me getting on the bike and then heading off. Music is playing in the background.

After 8 secs the title for the video pops up where I apply the V Reorder pasue effect for the Aavatar's entry


Viewer:	Choto Matte! Open channel on the background and highlight the last upload date



Zanark: Yeah sorry about that, I got a bit busy with life and stuff, I'll explain why I was away in a bit in b/w some clips in the Vlog.

The Vlog starts 

--Show the map graphic and the route you took--
--Explain that this is your first ride and hwo esxcited you were--


So this is a Vlog/catch up video for the channel

I am not gonna lie I have been feeling this sense of dread for a long time now. Not everything interests me anymore and its just sad. I did not have a solution or an answer to the question: Why am I feeling like this? However I think I'm close to finding a temporary solution if you can call it that.

I came across Matt Devalla's video on the topic: Why your life feels like its flying by, cuz honestly it feels like it is, and in this video he beautifuly explains why do we feel like this, and the reason aint the fact that we are busy, the reason is the fact that we are busy with monotonous stuff.

When we were kids, every day used to feel like a long day, I still remember somde days where it took ages for the moon to show up, let alone the day ending. And the reason behind this is the feeling of **Novelty**


Novelty basically means the experience of working on something new or a new experience in general and when we were kids everything was new and we used to feel like a week had passed in the span of a single day whereas if we compare that with our life now we feel like every day is passing by in a blink. Honestly this blew my mind.


Now how does that relate to this channel? I'm actually gonan make it the theme of this channel. Novelty is the theme of this channel now. New experiences, new tasks, new projects, new stuff and many more new things, thats what this channel is gonna be about now. I'm not gonna follow any product or category for this channel, today I might post a video on Cycling, tmrw I might post a video on Calisthenics, the one after that could be about Programming and the one after that about art or philosophy or some random book I read.

I am not gonna care about the kind of videos I upload here or the topic that I upload it on, cuz the theme of the channel is experiencing Novelty and I really hope this will be a novelexperience for you too when it comes to following channels.

Here's to a great time together!
